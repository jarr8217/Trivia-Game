# Trivia Game

This is a Trivia Game application built using React and custom CSS. The app allows users to test their knowledge across various categories and difficulty levels. It demonstrates the following concepts:

- **Component Composition**: Modular and reusable React components.
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions like form submissions and button clicks.
- **API Data Fetching**: Fetching trivia questions dynamically from an external API.
- **State Management**: Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage application state.

## Features

- User can input their name, select a category, and choose a difficulty level.
- Dynamically fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
- Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.
- Option to restart the quiz.

This project helped reinforce best practices in React development and CSS styling.
